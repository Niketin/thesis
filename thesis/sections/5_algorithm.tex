\section{Algorithm} \label{sec:algorithm}

In this section, we will introduce the basic idea of an essential algorithm that finds a proof that an LCL problem is impossible to solve in the PN model.
In case the algorithm detects the problem as unsolvable, it outputs a multigraph as a result.
We prove that this multigraph is enough to show that the problem is unsolvable in the PN model.
This is shown together in Sections \ref{sec:algorithm:from_multiple_to_simple} and \ref{sec:algorithm:from_finite_to_infinite}.
We also prove that if an LCL problem is unsolvable in the PN model, then the problem is not solvable in constant time in the LOCAL model.
This is shown in Section \ref{sec:algorithm:from_pn_to_local}.

% In Section \ref{sec:algorithm:from_multiple_to_simple} we show that the unsolvability of a problem in finite PN networks with multiple connections implies the unsolvability of the problem in finite simple PN networks.
% Later in Section \ref{sec:algorithm:from_finite_to_infinite}, we show that the unsolvability of the problem in finite PN networks implies the unsolvability of the problem in infinite tree PN networks.
% Finally, in Section \ref{sec:algorithm:from_pn_to_local}, we show that the unsolvability of the problem in infinite tree PN networks implies the problem is not solvable in constant time in the LOCAL model.
%
First, we start with defining the meaning of solvability of an LCL problem in the PN model.
\begin{definition} \label{def:lcl_solvability}
    An LCL problem $\Pi$ is solvable in PN model, if and only if there exists a PN algorithm $A$ that finds a solution for $\Pi$ in all PN networks.
\end{definition}

We can define an alternative version of the Definition \ref{def:lcl_solvability} using contraposition.
\begin{corollary} \label{cor:lcl_solvability:contrapositive}
An LCL problem $\Pi$ is not solvable in PN model, if and only if there does not exist a PN algorithm $A$ that finds a solution for $\Pi$ in all PN networks.
\end{corollary}

Definition \ref{def:lcl_solvability} and Corollary \ref{cor:lcl_solvability:contrapositive} are equivalent. The corollary might be more difficult to understand because of the contraposition, but we find it necessary to be shown as we find more fitting to discuss unsolvability rather than solvability.

We have illustrated two examples of unsolvable LCL problems in Tables \ref{tbl:unsolvable_lcl:1} and \ref{tbl:unsolvable_lcl:2}, where the values ``Y'' (Yes) and ``N'' (No) answer to the question: \emph{can the algorithm in this row solve the problem in the network of this column?}
Value of ``Y/N'' indicates that the value does not matter for the purpose of the example.
In both examples, there are only finite number of networks and algorithms for the sake of simplicity.
In Table \ref{tbl:unsolvable_lcl:1}, the problem $\Pi$ is unsolvable, because there is at least one network for each algorithm, where the algorithm fails to solve the problem.
In Table \ref{tbl:unsolvable_lcl:2}, we show an example that is a special case of Corollary \ref{cor:lcl_solvability:contrapositive}.
The problem $\Pi'$ is also unsolvable, but this time no algorithm can solve it in network $N'_{n'}$.

    \label{tbl:unsolvable_lcl:2}
    }
\end{table}

Not every unsolvable LCL problem necessarily fall within the case shown in Table~\ref{tbl:unsolvable_lcl:2}.
Nevertheless, we are interested in it, because it seems more feasible to find a single network where all algorithms fail, in comparison to finding a network for each algorithm separately.
The special case is written as follows.

\begin{lemma} \label{lem:lcl_unsolvability}
    An LCL problem $\Pi$ is not solvable in PN model, if there exists a PN network $N$ such that no PN algorithm $A$ can solve the problem $\Pi$ in network $N$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
    Let $\Pi$ be an LCL problem.
    Let $N$ be a PN network such that no PN algorithm $A$ can solve $\Pi$ in $N$.
    Therefore, no PN algorithm $A$ can find a solution to $\Pi$ in all PN networks.
    According to Corollary \ref{cor:lcl_solvability:contrapositive}, the problem $\Pi$ is unsolvable.
\end{proof}

As the Lemma \ref{lem:lcl_unsolvability} shows us, to show that a problem $\Pi$ is unsolvable, it is enough to find a counterexample, a PN network $N$ in which the problem $\Pi$ cannot be solved.
To show that, it is enough to find an underlying graph $G$ of network $N$ in which the problem $\Pi$ cannot be solved.

\begin{lemma} \label{lem:problem_unsolvability_in_graphs}
    If a problem $\Pi$ is not solvable in graph $G$, then $\Pi$ is also not solvable in any PN network $N$ that has $G$ as its underlying graph.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
    We prove by showing a contradiction.
    Let us assume the opposite of the lemma.
    That is, problem $\Pi$ is not solvable in graph $G$, and $\Pi$ is solvable in some PN network $N$ that has $G$ as its underlying graph.
    This means that network $N$ has a valid labeling, thus its underlying graph $G$ has also a valid labeling.
    This is a contradiction, therefore the original implication must be true.
\end{proof}

With the fact from Lemma \ref{lem:problem_unsolvability_in_graphs}, we create an algorithm that automatically tries to find a counterexample graph.
The algorithm is written as follows.

\begin{algorithm}[H]
    \caption{Counterexample graph finder}
    \label{alg:counterexample_finder}
    \begin{algorithmic}[1] % The number tells where the line numbering should start
        \Require $1 \leq n_{low} \leq n_{high}$

            \State $\Delta \gets \textsc{ActiveDegree}(\Pi)$ \label{alg:counterexample_finder:d_a}
            \State $\delta \gets \textsc{PassiveDegree}(\Pi)$ \label{alg:counterexample_finder:d_p}
            \For{$n\gets n_{low}, n_{high}$} \Comment{Iterate graph sizes from lowest to highest} \label{alg:counterexample_finder:n}
                \State $G_n \gets \textsc{GenerateGraphs}(n, \Delta, \delta)$ \label{alg:counterexample_finder:Gn}
                \ForEach{$g \in G_n$} \label{alg:counterexample_finder:g}
                    \If {\Not $\textsc{SolutionExists}(\Pi, g)$} \label{alg:counterexample_finder:solution_exists}
                        \State \Return $g$ \Comment{Return counterexample.}\label{alg:counterexample_finder:return_g}
                    \EndIf
                \EndFor
            \EndFor
            \State \Return \Comment{No counterexample found. Return nothing.} \label{alg:counterexample_finder:return_nothing}
        \EndFunction
    \end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

The Algorithm \ref{alg:counterexample_finder} is designed to find the smallest counterexample graph for an LCL problem $\Pi$.
It starts from graphs with $n_{low}$ vertices and goes up to graphs with $n_{high}$ vertices.
We define $\Delta$ and $\delta$ to be the active and passive degree of the problem $\Pi$ respectively (rows \ref{alg:counterexample_finder:d_a} and \ref{alg:counterexample_finder:d_p}).
The variable for the current vertex count is called $n$ (row~\ref{alg:counterexample_finder:n}).
For each $n$, we generate all possible $(\Delta, \delta)$-biregular multigraphs with $\textsc{GenerateGraphs}(n, \Delta, \delta)$, and save the multigraphs into variable $G_n$ (row~\ref{alg:counterexample_finder:Gn}).
%The reason for generating only these types of multigraphs comes from the LCL formalism from Section \ref{sec:lcl_problems:biregular}.
Now, for each multigraph $g \in G_n$ (row~\ref{alg:counterexample_finder:g}) we check if the given problem $\Pi$ has a solution using the function $\textsc{SolutionExists}(\Pi, g)$ (row~\ref{alg:counterexample_finder:solution_exists}).
If a solution does not exist, we return the multigraph as a counterexample (row~\ref{alg:counterexample_finder:return_g}).
In the case there are no counterexamples in multigraphs between $n_{low}$ and $n_{high}$ vertices, the algorithm returns nothing (row~\ref{alg:counterexample_finder:return_nothing}).

Up to this moment, we have not discussed how the function \[ \textsc{GenerateGraphs}(n, \Delta, \delta) \] from row~\ref{alg:counterexample_finder:Gn} actually generates the multigraphs, nor have we discussed how the function \[ \textsc{SolutionExists}(\Pi, g) \] from row~\ref{alg:counterexample_finder:solution_exists} determines the existence of a solution.
These functions are implementation specific and in this section we assume that they exist as black boxes.
We discuss our implementations of these functions later in Section~\ref{sec:implementation}.
However, we can discuss why the algorithm generates multigraphs instead of simple graphs.
The algorithm generates multigraphs, because they are less restrictive than simple graphs.
Thus, we generate more graphs when multiple edges are allowed, which implies more possibilities to find a counterexample.

As we said before, we use the LCL formalism from Section \ref{sec:lcl_problems:biregular}.
The formalism uses infinite $(\Delta, \delta)$-biregular trees, but the algorithm generates finite $(\Delta, \delta)$-biregular multigraphs.
In Section~\ref{sec:algorithm:from_multiple_to_simple}, we show that it is enough to find $(\Delta, \delta)$-biregular network with multiple connections, where the problem is unsolvable, because it implies that it is also unsolvable in some simple $(\Delta, \delta)$-biregular network.
This can be derived to work with graphs with Lemma~\ref{lem:problem_unsolvability_in_graphs}.
In Section~\ref{sec:algorithm:from_finite_to_infinite}, we show that if an LCL problem is unsolvable in finite connected $(\Delta, \delta)$-biregular graph $G$ with cycles, then it is also unsolvable in some infinite $(\Delta, \delta)$-biregular tree $G'$.
Finite $(\Delta, \delta)$-biregular graphs are always with cycles, when both $\Delta$ and $\delta$ are greater than 1, and this is in practice always the case, because we are not interested in biregular graphs with $\Delta=1$ or $\delta=1$ as they are trivial.


\subsection{From multiple connection networks to simple networks} \label{sec:algorithm:from_multiple_to_simple}

In this section we show that if an LCL problem is not solvable in PN networks with multiple connections, then the problem is also not solvable in simple PN networks.

% Pi is unsolvable in multiple connection PN network N -> Pi is unsolvable in lift of N
\begin{lemma} \label{lem:lcl_unsolvability:from_multiple_to_lift}
If an LCL problem $\Pi$ is not solvable in PN network $N$, then it is also not solvable in any PN network $N'$ that is a lift of $N$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
    Let problem $\Pi$ have no solution in some PN network $N$.
    Then any algorithm $A$ produces a result that is invalid solution to $\Pi$ i.e. a local constraint is violated at least at some node $v$.
    Let $\phi: V' \rightarrow V$ be a covering map from $N'=(V', P', p')$ to $N=(V, P, p)$.
    Theorem 7.1 from the textbook \cite{HirvonenSuomelaDistAlg2020} shows that the nodes of $N'$ will have exactly the same state as their counterparts at $N$ for each time unit $t=0,1,...$
    Hence, if we run algorithm $A$ on both networks $N$ and $N'$, the local constraint violation at some node $v \in N$ also appears in all nodes $v' \in V'$ such that $\phi(v') = v$ i.e. the local constraint violations also appear in the covering network $N'$.
\end{proof}

% Network with multiple connections ----k-lift--->  simple network
\begin{lemma} \label{lem:lcl_unsolvability:from_klift_to_simple}
    If there is a PN network $N_2$ with multiple connections with $k$ being the highest count of multiple connections between any two nodes, then there exists a $k$-lift $N_1$ of $N_2$ such that $N_1$ is a simple PN network.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
    Let $N_2=(V_2, P_2, p_2)$ be a PN network with multiple connections.
    Let $\operatorname{mul}(u, v)$ be the number of connections between any nodes $u, v \in V_2$.
    The highest count of multiple connections between two nodes is $k=\max (\{ m(u, v) \mid u, v \in V_2\} )$.
    Let $\operatorname{M}(x+hk) = x$ for all $x = 1, ..., k$ and $h\in \mathbb{N}$, for example $\operatorname{M}(1 + hk) = 1$ and $\operatorname{M}(k + hk) = k$.

    Let there be another network $N_1=(V_1, P_1, p_1)$ such that:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item For each $v \in V_2$, there are $k$ clones in $V_1$, namely the nodes $v_1, v_2, ..., v_k \in V_1$.
        Thus, the sizes $|V_1|$ and $k|V_2|$ are equal.
        \item For each port $(v, i) \in P_2$, we have ports $(v_x, i) \in P_1$ where $x=1, 2, ..., k$.
        \item For each connection $p_2((v, i_a)) = (u, j_a)$ where $a = 1, 2, ..., \operatorname{mul}(u, v)$, we have $p_1((v_{x}, i_a)) = (u_{\operatorname{M}(x+a-1)}, j_a)$.
        Note that if $\operatorname{mul}(u, v) = 1$, then $p_1((v_{x}, i_1)) = (u_{\operatorname{M}(x)}, j_1) = (u_{x}, j_1)$.
    \end{itemize}

    Now we show that there is a covering map $\phi: V_1 \rightarrow V_2$.
    Let $\phi(v_x) = v \in V_2$ for each $v_x \in V_1$ where $x=1, 2, ..., k$.
    We will show that $\phi$ is a covering map using the Definition \ref{def:covering_map}:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item By the definition of $\phi$, it is surjective.
        \item For each connection in $N_2$, we have $k$ similar connections in $N_1$, therefore degrees of each node are preserved.
        %% TODO remove these comments when this has been reviewed.
        %\item For each non-multiple connection $p_1((v_x, i)) = (u_x, j)$, where $x=1, 2, ..., k$, we have $p_2((v, i)) = (u, j)$.
        %From our definition of $\phi$ we can see that the mapping preserves port numbers and connections in non-multiple connections.
        %\item For each multiple connection $p_1((v_{x}, i_a)) = (u_{\operatorname{M}(x+a-1)}, j_a)$ we have
        %\begin{align*}
        %    p_2((\phi(v_{x}), i_a)) &= (\phi(u_{\operatorname{M}(x+a-1)}), j_a)\\
        %    \Leftrightarrow p_2((v, i_a)) &= (u, j_a)
        %\end{align*}
        %Both $(v, i_a)$ and $(u, j_a)$ are in $P_2$ and $p_2((v, i_a)) = (u, j_a)$, therefore for each multiple connection, the port numbers and connections are preserved.
        \item For each connection $p_1((v_{x}, i_a)) = (u_{\operatorname{M}(x+a-1)}, j_a)$ we have
        \begin{align*}
           p_2((\phi(v_{x}), i_a)) &= (\phi(u_{\operatorname{M}(x+a-1)}), j_a)\\
           \Leftrightarrow p_2((v, i_a)) &= (u, j_a)
        \end{align*}
        Both $(v, i_a)$ and $(u, j_a)$ are in $P_2$ and $p_2((v, i_a)) = (u, j_a)$, therefore for each connection, the port numbers and connections are preserved.
    \end{itemize}
    Each condition holds, hence the function $\phi$ is a covering map from $V_1$ to $V_2$
    therefore $N_1$ is a $k$-lift of $N_2$.

    We need to show that $N_1$ is a simple PN network i.e. it does not have multiple connections.
    %As we know, the non-multiple connections in $N_2$ are preserved in $N_1$ therefore we need to only look at the multiple connections of $N_2$ in more detail.
    There exists connections $p_1((v_{x}, i_a)) = (u_{\operatorname{M}(x+a-1)}, j_a)$ where $a=1, 2, ..., \operatorname{mul}(\phi(v_{x}),\phi(u_{\operatorname{M}(x+a-1)}))$.
    We see that nodes $u_{\operatorname{M}(x+a-1)}$ are distinct for all $a$ because $1 \leq a \leq \operatorname{mul}(\phi(v_{x}),\phi(u_{\operatorname{M}(x+a-1)})) \leq k$ and
    there are exactly k many "u" nodes in $V_1$, namely nodes $u_1, u_2, ..., u_k \in V_1$.
    Thus, for each node $v_x$, all connections from $v_x$ are mapped to distinct nodes, therefore $N_1$ is simple.

    The network $N_2$ is connected by the assumption (Section \ref{sec:underlying_graph}) but it might not be clear that $N_1$ is connected, thus we show next that this is the case.

    Let us look at all connections in $p_1$ and fix $a=1$.
    Then $p_1((v_{x}, i_a)) = (u_{\operatorname{M}(x+a-1)}, j_a)$
    $=p_1((v_{x}, i_1)) = (u_{x}, j_1)$.
    This shows that we can traverse from any node $w_x\in P$ to any other node $w'_x\in P$ only using nodes with subscript $x$.

    There are at least some nodes $u, v \in P_2$ such that $\operatorname{mul}(u,v) = k$, therefore we can traverse from any $u_x \in P_1$ to any $v_y \in P_1$ for any $x, y \in \{1, 2, ..., k\}$.
    Thus, $N_1$ is connected.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma} \label{lem:lcl_unsolvability:from_multiple_to_simple}
    If an LCL problem $\Pi$ is not solvable in PN network $N_2$ with multiple connections, then it is also not solvable in simple PN network $N_1$ that is a lift of $N_2$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
    Let us assume that an LCL problem $\Pi$ is not solvable in PN network $N_2$ with multiple connections.
    Lemma \ref{lem:lcl_unsolvability:from_klift_to_simple} shows that there exists a k-lift $N_1$ of $N_2$ such that $N_1$ is a simple PN network.
    Lemma \ref{lem:lcl_unsolvability:from_multiple_to_lift} shows that the problem $\Pi$ is also not solvable in network $N_1$.
    Therefore, we deduce that the problem $\Pi$ is not solvable in simple PN network $N_1$ that is a lift of $N_2$.

\subsection{From finite to infinite} \label{sec:algorithm:from_finite_to_infinite}
Our algorithm outputs a finite connected $(\Delta, \delta)$-biregular multigraph with cycles, but in the LCL formalism, graphs are infinite $(\Delta, \delta)$-biregular trees.
With Lemma~\ref{lem:lcl_unsolvability:from_multiple_to_simple}, we get simple networks from networks with multiple connections, but we also need to show how unsolvability in finite networks with cycles imply unsolvability in infinite tree networks.
Instead of showing this with networks, we do it with graphs.
With Lemma~\ref{lem:problem_unsolvability_in_graphs}, it immediately applies also to networks.
%In the LCL formalism, the trees are infinite, so any naive approach of encoding these graphs would not suffice.
%Instead of generating infinite $(\Delta, \delta)$-biregular trees and finding some finite encoding for them, we can generate finite sized connected $(\Delta, \delta)$-biregular graphs with cycles.

\begin{lemma} \label{lem:from_finite_to_infinite}
    If an LCL problem $\Pi$ is unsolvable in finite connected $(\Delta, \delta)$-biregular graph $G$ with cycles, then it is also unsolvable in some infinite $(\Delta, \delta)$-biregular tree $G'$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
    Let us have a problem $\Pi$ that is unsolvable in finite connected $(\Delta, \delta)$-biregular graph $G=(V, E)$ with cycles.
    We construct an infinite $(\Delta, \delta)$-biregular tree $G'=(V', E')$ by \emph{unfolding} graph $G$.
    Let $v \in V$ be a seed node.
    We consider all possible non-backtracking walks from node $v$.
    Each walk is considered as a node of $G'$, and \emph{adjacent} walks are considered as adjacent nodes in $G'$.
    For example $v-a-b-c-a$ and $v-a-b-c-a-b$ are considered as adjacent walks, therefore they represent adjacent nodes in $G'$.
    Graph $G$ has cycles, therefore there are infinite walks of infinite length.
    Walks are non-backtracking, therefore the constructed graph $G'$ must be $(\Delta, \delta)$-biregular.
    We can see that $G'$ is a covering graph of $G$.
    Using Lemma \ref{lem:lcl_unsolvability:from_multiple_to_lift}, we deduct that the problem $\Pi$ must also be unsolvable in $G'$.
\end{proof}

%With Lemma \ref{lem:from_finite_to_infinite}, we can focus on finding finite connected $(\Delta, \delta)$-biregular graphs with cycles.

Now with Lemmas \ref{lem:problem_unsolvability_in_graphs}, \ref{lem:lcl_unsolvability:from_multiple_to_simple}, and \ref{lem:from_finite_to_infinite}, the output graphs from our algorithm imply the unsolvability in infinite $(\Delta, \delta)$-biregular trees in the PN model.

\subsection{From PN to LOCAL} \label{sec:algorithm:from_pn_to_local}

In this section we prove the following theorem:
\begin{theorem} \label{thm:algorithm:from_pn_to_local:lcl_unsolvability}
    If an LCL problem is unsolvable in the PN model, then the problem is also not solvable in constant time in the LOCAL model.
\end{theorem}

First, we introduce related lemmas, and at the end of this section, we prove Theorem~\ref{thm:algorithm:from_pn_to_local:lcl_unsolvability}.
The lemmas form a chain of implications shown in Figure~\ref{fig:proof_order:lcl_unsolvability}.
In the figure, there are two models we have to briefly introduce.
Both models are similar to the LOCAL and PN models in a sense that they are also message passing models.

The first model is called \emph{order-invariant} (OI) \cite{DBLP:journals/siamcomp/NaorS95}.
The OI model can be thought as a LOCAL model with a restriction where each node can only compare the identifiers but not access their exact value.
In the model, the output of an algorithm does not change even if identifiers of nodes are changed as long as their relative order is preserved.

The second model called \emph{port numbering + orientation} (PO)~\cite{DBLP:conf/istcs/MayerNS95}.
In the model, ports are numbered like in the PN model and additionally the edges have an orientation~\cite{DBLP:journals/dc/GoosHS17}.

%%%% O(1) LOCAL in general graphs
% -> O(1) LOCAL in trees
\begin{lemma} \label{lem:algorithm:from_pn_to_local:o1_local_gen_imply_o1_local_trees}
    If an LCL problem is solvable in constant time in the LOCAL model, then the problem is solvable in constant time in trees in the LOCAL model.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
    This is trivial, because general graphs contain the graph family of trees.
\end{proof}

%%%% O(1) LOCAL in trees
% -> O(1) OI in trees
\begin{lemma} \label{lem:algorithm:from_pn_to_local:o1_local_trees_imply_o1_oi_trees}
    If an LCL problem is solvable in constant time in trees in the LOCAL model, then the problem is solvable in constant time in trees in the OI model.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
    This has been proved for any fixed graph family in the work from Naor and Stockmeyer \cite[theorem 3.3]{DBLP:journals/siamcomp/NaorS95}.
    The proof applies Ramsey theory to show that there exists a finite set $Y$ of identifiers such that for all $X_1, X_2 \subseteq Y$ with $|X_1| = |X_2| = s$, we have a constant time LOCAL algorithm giving identical results in any graph family whether we use identifiers $X_1$ or $X_2$.
    It shows that the constant time LOCAL algorithm applied to identifiers from set $Y$ behaves like an OI algorithm.
\end{proof}

%%%% O(1) OI in trees
% -> O(1) PO in trees
\begin{lemma} \label{lem:algorithm:from_pn_to_local:o1_oi_trees_imply_o1_po_trees}
    If an LCL problem is solvable in constant time in trees in the OI model, then the problem is solvable in constant time in trees in the PO model.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
    Suppose there is a t-time PO algorithm that solves an LCL problem.
    The work from Göös et al.~\cite{DBLP:journals/dc/GoosHS17} shows that a PO algorithm can simulate an OI algorithm to solve the problem in t-time.
\end{proof}

Now we prove Theorem \ref{thm:algorithm:from_pn_to_local:lcl_unsolvability}:
\begin{proof}
    Let us have an LCL problem $\Pi$ that is unsolvable in the PN model.
    In the LCL formalism, we have active and passive nodes.
    Let $N = (V, P, p)$ be an infinite ($\Delta, \delta$)-biregular tree network.
    Let $u, v \in V$ be distinct active nodes such both $u$ and $v$ are adjacent to passive node $w\in V$.
    We can define an orientation between $u$ and $v$ by looking at the ports of node $w$.
    Let the port that connects from $w$ to $u$ be $(w, i)$, and let the port that connects from $w$ to $v$ be $(w, j)$.
    Port numbers $i$ and $j$ are distinct, therefore we can say that if $i < j$, then $u < v$.
    Otherwise, we say that $v < u$.
    Now, if we interpret the passive nodes as $\delta-uniform$ hyperedges, we have can say that we have an orientation between any two adjacent nodes.
    Thus, when we work in the LCL formalism, we are actually already working in the PO model.
    Thus, $\Pi$ is also unsolvable in the PO model.

    Now, as shown in Figure \ref{fig:proof_order:lcl_unsolvability}, Lemmas \ref{lem:algorithm:from_pn_to_local:o1_local_gen_imply_o1_local_trees}, \ref{lem:algorithm:from_pn_to_local:o1_local_trees_imply_o1_oi_trees}, and \ref{lem:algorithm:from_pn_to_local:o1_oi_trees_imply_o1_po_trees} form a chain of implications.
    This means that when there does not exist a constant time PO algorithm in trees for some LCL problem, there also does not exist a constant time LOCAL algorithm for the problem in general graphs.
    The problem $\Pi$ is unsolvable in the PN model and in the PO model.
    Therefore, problem $\Pi$ cannot be solved in constant time in the LOCAL model for general graphs.
\end{proof}



Now we have shown Theorem~\ref{thm:algorithm:from_pn_to_local:lcl_unsolvability}.
Therefore, the results from our algorithm now imply the problem is not solvable in constant time in the LOCAL model.
