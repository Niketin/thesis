How can we determine the unsolvability of an LCL problem in PN model?

What new nonsolvable LCL problems can we find in the PN model? \todo{Refer to the thesis of LCL-classifier}

When an LCL problem is nonsolvable in the 
How can we efficiently repeat the process of finding lower bound proofs for multiple different LCL problems?

%In this thesis, we will prove a theorem that an unsolvability of an LCL problem in the PN model implies that the problem is also not solvable in constant time in the LOCAL model.
%Using this theorem, we will implement a tool that can automatically find a proof of nonsolvability of an LCL problem in the PN model.
%We especially want this tool to work efficiently, leveraging parallelism.
%To conclude, our objective is to find new lower bounds for LCL problems efficiently.
