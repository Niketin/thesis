\section{Research questions} \label{sec:research_question}

There are LCL problems that cannot be solved in PN model.
More specifically, there exists LCL problems such that no PN-algorithm can solve it in \emph{every} graph.
One such case is that no
for which no PN-algorithm can solve in every  in some simple graphs as there are no valid labellings for the graph.

How can we determine the unsolvability of an LCL problem in PN model?

What new unsolvable LCL problems can we find in the PN model? \todo{Refer to the thesis of LCL-classifier}

When an LCL problem is unsolvable in the 
How can we efficiently repeat the process of finding lower bound proofs for multiple different LCL problems?

%In this thesis, we will prove a theorem that an unsolvability of an LCL problem in the PN model implies that the problem is also not solvable in constant time in the LOCAL model.
%We will also implement a tool that can automatically find a proof of unsolvability of an LCL problem in the PN model.
%Together with the theorem and the tool, we can derive lower bounds in LOCAL.
%We especially want this tool to work efficiently, leveraging parallelism.
%To conclude, our objective is to find automatically new lower bounds for LCL problems in the LOCAL model.
