In this section, we discuss the related studies that have been released prior to this work.

\subsection{Classifiers}

A \emph{classifier} is a tool that can automatically determine a lower bound or an upper bound for an LCL problem.

%TODO I'll draft some sections here that I probably should consider writing about.
% Some might be really similar or even identical.
\subsection{\color{red}These sections are WIP, they do not necessarily stay this way, and each section probably does not stay under their own section}
\subsection{Lower and upper bounds of LCL's}
\subsection{Complexity classifications of LCL's}
\subsection{Computation of lower and upper bounds}
%TODO somewhere talk about the complexity classes, how there are infinitely many complexity classes, but in some models, range of complexity classes are equal. There are gaps in the complexity thingy.

\subsection{Complexity landscape of LCL's}
