\section{Prior work} \label{sec:prior_work}
In this section, we discuss the related studies that have been released prior to this work.
First, we discuss the ... in Section \ref{sec:prior_work:title_a}.

\subsection{Meta computing and algorithm synthetization etc\todo{fix title}} \label{sec:prior_work:title_a}

Given that we have an interesting computational problem, we would like to learn something new about the computability of the problem in terms of computational complexity.
There are usually two desirable results that we would want to discover.
The first desirable result is an efficient algorithm that solves the computational problem.
The existence of such algorithm would show that the problem is solvable with \emph{at least} at the speed of the algorithm.
The second desirable result would be the information that such efficient algorithm does not exist.
We say that the former results, showing existence or possibility, are \emph{positive} results, and the latter results, showing nonexistence or impossibility, are \emph{negative} results.
In our work, the objective is to find negative results, but we would also like to discuss finding positive results as it gives better overall view on the subject.

Traditionally, new algorithms have been found using
The first one, that we are targeting at in this thesis, is that we show the problem to not be solvable 
When we are attempting to 

There has been a lot of effort in showing positive results in the foundations


When we look at the 
From the bird's eye view, our work is one 

\subsection{Classifiers}

A \emph{classifier} is a tool that can automatically determine a lower bound or an upper bound for an LCL problem.

\todo{round eliminator, other classifiers (from aleksandr's lcl-classifier?)}
In our work, we focus only on showing negative results, i.e. we show that something is not possible to achieve, in a form of a lower bound.
In particular, we do

% Some might be really similar or even identical.

%TODO somewhere talk about the complexity classes, how there are infinitely many complexity classes, but in some models, range of complexity classes are equal. There are gaps in the complexity thingy.
