\section{Prior work} \label{sec:prior_work}


%TODO I'll draft some sections here that I probably should consider writing about.
% Some might be really similar or even identical.
\subsection{\todo{these sections are WIP and they do not necessarily stay this way and each probably does not stay under their own section.}}
\subsection{Lower and upper bounds of LCL's}
\subsection{Complexity classifications of LCL's}
\subsection{Computation of lower and upper bounds}
%TODO somewhere talk about the complexity classes, how there are infinitely many complexity classes, but in some models, range of complexity classes are equal. There are gaps in the complexity thingy.
\subsection{Computation in complexity theory}
\subsection{Complexity landscape of LCL's}
\subsection{Computer assisted ??? in complexity theory}
