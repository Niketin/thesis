\section{Summary} \label{sec:summary}

One of our objectives was to automate the proving that an LCL problem is unsolvable in the PN model.
We presented a novel algorithm that can detect the unsolvability of the problem first in finite connected $(\Delta, \delta)$-biregular multigraphs by generating all non-isomorphic multigraphs of this family in the sizes $n_\text{low}, ..., n_\text{high}$.
This was further shown to be proof of unsolvability of the problem in PN networks that had the PN model

In this thesis, we have found satisfying answers to each of our research questions.
