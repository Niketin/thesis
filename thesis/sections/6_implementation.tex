%\section{Automatically proving lower bounds for LCL problems} \label{sec:implementation}
\section{Implementation} \label{sec:implementation}
In this chapter we will cover all the important topics that are used in the actual implementation.
The implementation itself is a computer program, that attempts to automatically find a proof which shows the nonsolvability of the given LCL problem in PN model (see section \ref{sec:port_number_model} for more information about PN model).
%TODO should the discussion of the implementation be after explanation of the topics?
